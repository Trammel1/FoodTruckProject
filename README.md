## Food Truck Project
# Week 2 Homework Project for Skill Distillery
	
## Description
A food Truck app that allows the user to input Food Truck names, type of food, rating, and unique truck id. The program will allow the user to quit before they enter a truck name to see the whole menu. From the menu you have 4 numerical options. The options are list all food trucks, see average rating of all food trucks,  the highest rated food truck, and an option to quit the program.

## Lessons Learned
I learned how to keep loops running this week while they are needed and different ways to prompt the program to quit when the user requests. I chose to use an if Boolean followed by a break, and a switch statement to get the menu to show when they enter quit. The switch statement, "which is fun" has all the menu selections and thats where I place most of the variable functions for the program.
